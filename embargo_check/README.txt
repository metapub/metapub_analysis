The set of scripts in this directory were used to take a closeup look at the 
"embargo" classification of papers and how these data changed before and 
after the paper's embargo date.

Work was done to figure out the bug wherein FindIt incorrectly reported that 
a paper could not be downloaded because it was still in embargo.  This bug
was fixed in June 2023.
